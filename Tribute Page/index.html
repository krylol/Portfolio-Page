            <p>Raymond Reddington attended the United States Naval Academy, graduating at the top of his class at the age of 24, and was being groomed for admiral when he disappeared while coming home to visit his family for Christmas in 1990. </p>
            <p>Four years later he resurfaced, selling classified documents to the enemy, and was charged with treason in absentia. Over the next 20 years he built a syndicate of contacts: spies, thieves, smugglers, drug traffickers, people smugglers, human traffickers, arms traffickers, counterfeiters, forgers, hackers, mercenaries, and assassins. During this time, U.S. assets located in Moscow, Islamabad, and Beijing were compromised.</p> 
            <p> He infiltrated the private sector, and there was no industry that was out of his reach, including technology, shipping, communications, security/military contracting and pharmaceuticals. Eventually he went from just selling secrets to starting wars, toppling governments, and influencing geopolitics to suit his needs. He became known as “the Concierge of Crime” due to his ability to arrange deals in the black market.</p>
            <p>He was ranked fourth, and later first, on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list as an “arrest on sight” fugitive, as shown when he surrendered to the FBI in “Pilot”. In a flashback in “Requiem”, Red reveals to Kathryn Nemec that he created his criminal network with the sole purpose of protecting Elizabeth Keen and when his enemies got too close, went to the FBI to ensure her protection more directly.</p>
